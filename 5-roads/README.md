# Misbehaviour detection in VANETs
This is a simple network with 5 roads. To run:
```
sumo-gui cross.sumocfg
```


In the network there are 5 roads. There are 5 detectors in these 5 roads which collect the traffic stats in these roads. The output is stored in the XML files named: "e3_0_<road_id>.xml", each for the 5 roads. The road in the middle is **road 1**.
